	<h1> This is a test of the HyperText Markup Language...language.</h1>

	<p style="font-size:16px">So guys, I'm really not sure what to put here, but I'm really just sort of testing my html knowledge that I haven't used in ages.</p>
	<p>Here's a joke I guess. Why did the chicken cross the road?</p>
	<br>
	<p style="color:red">The KFC exploded...</p>
	It's funny right? Isn't that so funny? Please laugh guys...please...guys I'm desperate I just want a friend guys I'm trying so hard.
	<br><br>
	<p>So, uh...you guys wanna see something neat? I have this uh...thing I think you'll like. 
	Yeah, I'll attach it here in a second. It's really cool though, guys, trust me.</p>

	<br><br>
	Wait fuck wrong image. Fuck how do I change the image? <br>

	NO FUCK OFF NOT THAT<br>
	<p>Fuck it I give up. Whatever, fuck off. 
	Don't ask why I have this and just...just get the hell out.</p>
	<br><br>

	<p>And by the fucking way, I could easily get a girlfriend if I watned to. I'm not afraid of women or anything, so get that horseshit out of your shitty fucking skull</p>
	<p style="color:red">You Bellend</p>

	<!--The Next Thing, Whatever That Is-->
	<h2 style="background-color:SlateBlue;">This Is a Fucking Website</h2>
		<p style="color:Gray">So uh, yeah so here I am, making a grotesque pile of shit. 
		You don't even need to host your website, just email that shit to people as a .zip or something.</p>

		<p style="color:#ff06b5">By the way, this sad sack of shit is on my Github (yeah I have one of those lmao).
		That's right, you can steal my shitty html document with a shitpost and a random anime girl on it. 
		Ain't that the motherfucking dream.</p>
